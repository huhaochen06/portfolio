This personal website represents both my professional showcase and creative playground. Built from the ground up, it balances clean, minimalist design with thoughtful interactive elements that invite exploration.

A standout feature is the memory sequence game nestled in the technologies section, challenging visitors to replicate patterns in the correct orderâ€”a small but engaging way to break the traditional portfolio mold. [Care to test your memory?](/)

The aesthetic draws inspiration from developers I admire, particularly [Abhijeet](https://www.abjt.dev) and [Duy Lee](https://www.duyle.dev), while incorporating design principles gathered from countless hours scrolling through X, Reddit, curated.design, and Dribbble. This research phase was crucial in developing a distinctive visual language that feels both contemporary and timeless.

While I'm pleased with the current implementation, I see this site as a living document rather than a finished product. In the coming months, I'll be expanding the blog section with interactive technical articles and implementing new features to enhance both functionality and design. The goal is to create a space that evolves alongside my professional journey and technical explorations.
