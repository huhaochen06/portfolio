Since 2023, I've been spearheading the development of Qibaodian, a sophisticated stock prediction SaaS platform that's gained significant traction in the Chinese financial market. Available at [qibaodian.net](https://qibaodian.net), the platform delivers actionable buy and sell predictions that help investors make more informed trading decisions.

As the sole developer responsible for the entire technical implementation, I've built, maintained, and continuously evolved this complex financial system from the ground up. My father, with his expertise in financial modeling, contributed exclusively to the predictive algorithm design, while I handled all aspects of architecture, development, deployment, and ongoing maintenance.

The technical foundation of Qibaodian reflects my commitment to building robust, scalable solutions. I crafted a tailored technology stack that includes:

- A high-performance Python API for comprehensive stock backtesting capabilities
- SvelteKit for crafting an intuitive frontend experience while managing core business logic
- TimescaleDB for efficient management of vast quantities of time-series financial data
- BullMQ for orchestrating resource-intensive recurring tasks with reliability
- Redis implementation for strategic caching that significantly enhances performance

One of the most rewarding challenges was designing a system architecture capable of processing real-time financial data at scale while maintaining consistent reliability for end users. This required thoughtful consideration of data flows, processing bottlenecks, and optimization opportunities.

Over the past two years, I've implemented dozens of feature enhancements and performance optimizations based on user feedback and market demands. The platform continues to evolve, with new capabilities currently in development to further solidify Qibaodian's position as a valuable tool for investors in the Chinese market.
