Our team of 5 took on an ambitious challenge - building a native app using Expo and React Native, even though none of us had done mobile development before. The idea was to create EcoQuest, an app that would make environmental activism more engaging through gamification.

We kicked things off with a week of planning - sketching out ideas, creating prototypes in Figma, and mapping out the app's flow in detail. While a couple of us had some Flask experience for the backend, React Native and Expo were completely new territory.

We had to learn fast - spending two days getting up to speed with React Native and Expo, and another day diving into Flask basics. Despite the time crunch, we managed to build a working prototype in just two days. Sure, we had to cut some planned features, but we still presented something functional to the judges. We didn't win any prizes, but the experience was invaluable, if a bit chaotic!

The project threw plenty of challenges our way. Different team members were using either iOS or Android, which made setting up consistent development environments tricky. Bugs kept popping up, and we had to learn to troubleshoot on the fly.
