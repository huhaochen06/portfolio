When our team of five decided to build EcoQuest, we embraced a classic "learn by doing" challenge. None of us had mobile development experience, yet we committed to creating a native app using Expo and React Native that would transform environmental activism through gamification.

We dedicated the first week entirely to planning—sketching concepts, designing prototypes in Figma, and meticulously mapping the user journey. While a couple of team members had dabbled in Flask for backend work, React Native and Expo represented uncharted territory for all of us.

The learning curve was steep - we dedicated two intense days to grasp React Native and Expo fundamentals, followed by another day immersing ourselves in Flask basics. Despite working against the clock, we managed to build a functioning prototype in just 48 hours. We had to make tough calls on feature prioritization, but we delivered something substantial to the judges. While we didn't take home any awards, the hands-on experience proved invaluable, even with its chaotic moments.

Technical hurdles emerged constantly throughout the project. Our mixed-device team (split between iOS and Android) faced consistent development environment challenges. Unexpected bugs regularly surfaced, forcing us to develop troubleshooting skills on the fly and adapt quickly to new technologies.

Looking back, EcoQuest represents much more than just a hackathon project—it was a transformative experience that pushed us beyond our comfort zones. The rapid transition from complete novices to shipping a functional mobile app taught us invaluable lessons about agile development, cross-platform considerations, and the importance of clear communication when navigating unfamiliar tech stacks.

While we didn't build the polished, feature-complete app we initially envisioned, what we gained in knowledge and confidence working with mobile technologies far outweighed any shortcomings in our final product. This experience fundamentally changed how we approach new technologies—with a hands-on, prototype-driven mindset rather than getting caught in analysis paralysis. The skills we developed during those intense few days continue to influence our approach to software development challenges, reminding us that sometimes the best way to learn is by diving in headfirst.
