In a 24-hour challenge at Hack&Roll 2024, my team of four dove headfirst into game developmentâ€”despite none of us having prior experience.

We created a unique 2D platformer that pits two players against each other in an exciting game of cat and mouse. One player controls a 'box' trying to reach the finish line, while the other wields a 'crayon' to draw obstacles and prevent the box's progress.

The box player uses WASD keys for movement and has access to special abilities: a dash move and a temporary phase ability that allows passing through crayon-drawn obstacles.

The crayon player uses the mouse to strategically draw lines across the level, creating barriers to impede the box's progress.

The game unfolds over three rounds, with players swapping roles between box and crayon. After each round, the losing player gets to choose a random powerup to even the odds. Victory goes to the first player to win three rounds.

The game was created using Godot, a free and open-source game engine.
